## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- BEM
- JSON

### What I learned

This is the first junior level project I worked on; the biggest difference I find between a junior project and a newbie one is the proficiency that is requried in Javascript. The JSON part wasn't that difficult since I actually use JSON on my own FM Github main site. Perhaps the biggest challenge I found wasn't with the coding but in figuring out the dimensions and sizes for everything because sometimes things don't line up with the designs given. It was also a challenge to name the classes in SCSS because I found myself nesting too many levels and eventually needed to figure out how to write everything in a way that's still succinct but readable. Overall, this was a fun weekend project, and I was proud of how bar graph turned.

### Continued development

Not sure how I'd use this in other projects, but I think one thing that can be worked on in my spare time is how to animate the bar charts to have them start from zero.

### Useful resources

- [min(), max(), clamp()](https://css-tricks.com/min-max-and-clamp-are-css-magic/) - This might have been the first time I really looked into how to use clamp, and even though I didn't end up using clamp() in the end, this is still useful for reference

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank myself for getting into Scrimba's weeklong challenges a month ago because not only did I throw myself back into programming after a long absence, I also made a few things that I managed to use as a reference here (such as the hovering info boxes).
